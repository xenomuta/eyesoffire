*Eyes of Fire*

A particle system written with openframeworks that simulates a fire flame overlapped over eyes detected on video stream...

Inspired by a pretty cool text written in the book of Revelation:

**Revelation 19:12**: 
*"His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."*
